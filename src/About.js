                <p>I'm Gurijala Pranathi, pursuing my B.E. in CSE from DSATM, Bengaluru. I’ve been passionate about the field I am currently graduating in and found a growing interest in programming. I’ve been learning and honing my skills in this field and have a good understanding of the subjects that were thought in my college. Not only I am enthusiastic about the field I am graduating in, I am also inclined towards extracurricular activities such as doing volunteering works. In my free time I enjoy going out with my friends and trying new cuisines, sketching, listening to music. </p>
